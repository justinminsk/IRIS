# IRIS

Analyzing data from iris flowers using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and pygal.

## Files

IRIS.ipynb - Main file looking thorugh the data with the addition of pygal.

Iris.csv - The data in csv format.

PandasandNumpy.ipynb - Learning tool I made for pandas. (https://www.kaggle.com/justinminsk/pandas-and-numpy-tutorial/)

kaggle_notebook.ipynb - My last pulled notebook from kaggle.

## Kaggle notebook page

My final kaggle notebok https://www.kaggle.com/justinminsk/iris-data/.

## Differences

Since kaggle does not support pygal you need to look at the IRIS.ipynb to see the pygal graphs, the final analyzes will be on the kaggle notebook, however. 

## Data

Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris.

## Useful Information

-Need Anaconda3 or at least Jupyter Notebook runing Python 3

-Need pandas, numpy, pygal, and matplotlib libraries
